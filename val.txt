<BOS>Underwater Acoustics Researcher The Sensors Division focuses on technology development for advanced sensor systems, particularly in the areas of airborne/surface-based radar, electronic warfare, underwater acoustics, hyperspectral imaging and EO/IR sensing. Within this role, we perform work at full system prototypes, experiment campaigns and technology component development. Particular development roles within the Sensors Division include RF analog/digital hardware, acoustic hardware, signal processing algorithms, machine learning algorithms, tracking/fusion, as well as real-time embedded processor implementation. STR is hiring an Underwater Acoustics Researcher to develop conceptual algorithms in signal processing, information processing, and/or artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML). Our team is inherently collaborative, with an abundance of knowledge which makes working together to tackle tough problems a pleasure. As the Acoustics Researcher you will be creating state of the art algorithms to address automating some of the country's toughest national security problems for the undersea domain, applying advanced signal processing, information processing, and AI/ML to transform raw acoustic sensor data into actionable information for our Armed Forces. The team has developed algorithms to process passive sonar, imaging sonar, and active sonar returns to detect and identify undersea targets. This position will offer the opportunity to work with a dedicated team of engineers, developers, and scientists with a proven track record of generating new algorithm concepts and transitioning them to real-time algorithms running in operational embedded systems, as well as those continually expand the undersea active, passive, and imaging sonar algorithm performance.<EOS>
