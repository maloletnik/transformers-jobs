<BOS>Explore the impact of imec’s technology solutions on tomorrow’s Machine Learning and AI systems.<EOS>
<BOS>In semiconductor industry, system scaling is the ultimate driver of technology scaling. There is a paradigm shift of CMOS Roadmap from transistor to system-performance expanding technology strategy beyond fundamental CMOS innovation. System-Technology Co-Optimization (STCO) is an attractive option where scaling at logic cell level will be complemented by scaling at a global system level. STCO involves the system (for example Server, board and CPU/SoC) to be disintegrated, and subsequently reintegrated more densely or efficiently by using imec integration technologies. The fundamental challenge in STCO is to find useful system level modules that can benefit immensely by enablement novel integration with next generation of logic and memory resulting optimization of power, cost and performance for targeted application domains. <EOS>

<BOS>The post-doc will investigate how to develop systems that learn and reason in an artificial intelligence and autonomous systems context. While there has been a lot of progress on both machine learning and machine reasoning, their integration remains a key open challenge in artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. The distinction between learning and reasoning is related to the differences between fast and slow thinking, between data-driven and knowledge-based approaches, and between symbolic versus subsymbolic representations. The project will build upon probabilistic (logic) programming and neuro-symbolic computation, which are different paradigms for integrating learning and reasoning. The former integrates logical and probabilistic graphical models, the later logical and neural approaches. The goal of the project is to develop probabilistic programming and neuro-symbolic approaches and systems, and apply them to autonomous sensor systems. Research in this project will be performed in close collaboration with two PhD students and post-doc(s) at Örebro University.<EOS>

<BOS>Research group and description of the research project<EOS>
<BOS>We develop novel computational solutions for a more accurate diagnosis of sleep apnea, investigating the relationship between the severity of individual respiratory events and the severity of sleep apnea, and developing novel wearable technologies for self-applicable monitoring of sleep disturbances. We have already developed machine learning and neural network-based approaches for estimation of sleep apnea severity, assessment of sleep apnea-related daytime sleepiness, and automatic detection of sleep stages. We have also commercialized a self-applicable and easy-to-use forehead patch for recording of EEG. We have published dozens of articles in high-level peer-reviewed journals and supervised four Ph.D. students until completion. Currently, ten Ph.D. students are under our supervision.<EOS>
<BOS> In this research project, the aim is to develop novel technical and computational solutions for the diagnosis of sleep apnea and for prediction of risk for sleep apnea-related comorbidities and symptoms. Solutions will be based on minimally sleep-disturbing wearable sensors and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning. The research project aims for a more accurate and personalized diagnosis of sleep apnea and measurement of daytime sleepiness and vigilance. The project also aims for simplifying the current measurement protocol to be more suitable for initial screening purposes, for example, in a neurological ward or home environment. The research is based on large international patient cohorts collected and analyzed in collaboration with world’s top-level researchers, clinicians, physicists, and engineers in the University of Reykjavik (Iceland), the Akershus University Hospital (Norway), The University of Queensland (Australia), Loewenstein Hospital (Israel), University of Pennsylvania (USA), and Charite University Hospital (Germany).<EOS>

Our research group is closely collaborating with industrial partners operating in the field of medical instrumentation and health technology and therefore, parts of the Ph.D. / Postdoctoral work can be carried out as joint projects with the industrial partners.<EOS>
<BOS> Technical solutions and computational tools to be developed in this project can lead to a paradigm shift in the diagnostics of sleep apnea and significantly enhance the estimation of the risk for most severe comorbidities. Furthermore, these methods can enable real-time evaluation of daytime sleepiness and vigilance and thus, decrease the risk for motor vehicle accidents in professional drivers.<EOS>
<BOS> The position will be filled, at first, for a period of one year starting from September 1, 2020, or as agreed. For both positions, six months’ probationary period is applied.

A special focus will be the industrial applications related to development and trial tests of MLFLs in the context of autonomous driving (car-object distance ranging, object recognition, moving objects speed tracing: Doppler LIDAR). The requirement of a new generation of LIDAR with object recognition ability is driven by the demand of high safety standards that autonomous driving vehicles will have to satisfy to guarantee an efficient service to society, by minimising the risk of accidents, especially in harsh and unpredictable environments.<EOS>

<BOS>I2CAT is opening a PhD position to investigate the application of AI/ML techniques in future 5G communication networks. The researcher will be part of a joint collaboration between the 5G and AI groups at i2CAT. This work will be part of the OpenVerso project where i2CAT is developing new algorithms and architectures for beyond 5G networks.<EOS>
<BOS>As Part Of Its Thesis The Researcher Will Investigate<EOS>
<BOS>I2CAT has a wide experience in the management and control of 5G networks based on SDN/NFV architectures. Hence, the researcher will have access to integrated 5G network testbeds and prototypes comprising radio, transport and compute domains.<EOS>
<BOS>Architectural extensions to the current 5G networks to support AI/ML management functions, including identifying what data needs to be collected from the various network domains, and what actions need to be enabled by the underlying 5G SDN/NFV architecture. As part of the architectural work the researcher will also investigate what ML frameworks are available to manage the lifecycle of machine learning models, which could be containerized and executed within the 5G network.<EOS>
<BOS>In addition to the architectural aspects, the researcher will spend most of its effort researching on algorithm design. A promising avenue being investigated at the moment is the application of Reinforcement Learning algorithms to network control and management use cases. However, the researcher will also consider supervised and unsupervised learning if needed. The following work-plan will be considered. First, a use case for the radio domain and a use case for the compute or transport domain will be defined. Second, the researcher will investigate how to set up an appropriate environment to test the developed algorithms, e.g. a network simulator. Third, the researcher will develop AI/ML algorithms for the two use cases. Finally, the researcher will validate the developed algorithms in the 5G testbed infrastructures available at i2CAT.<EOS>
<BOS>The researcher is expected to generate publications throughout this work, and actively contribute to the OpenVerso project.<EOS>

<BOS>Job Description / Role<EOS>
<BOS>Employment: Full Time<EOS>
<BOS>Postdoctoral Fellow in Mars Atmospheric Science<EOS>
<BOS>The National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) at UAE University (UAEU) in Al Ain, UAE seeks a candidate to join its Planetary Science Group (and the wider Earth and Planetary Science Unit) as a postdoctoral fellow. His/her focus will be on Mars dust storm research in preparation for and in support of the exploitation of scientific data from the upcoming Emirates Mars Mission, under the supervision of Dr Claus Gebhardt.<EOS>
<BOS>The anticipated start date is as soon as possible but is likely to be sometime during late Fall 2020, for an initial 2-year period. Review of applications will begin on 6 September 2020, and the position will remain open until filled.<EOS>
<BOS>The EMM science phase is scheduled to start in early-to-mid 2021. EMM is expected to provide an unprecedented dataset of satellite images covering the Martian surface and atmosphere. The planned work will start with imagery and dust-climatological-data from past and existing Mars satellite missions. The initial goal is a study to gauge the feasibility of extracting information about Mars dust storms from such observations. It is common practice to identify dust storms manually by the visual inspection of Mars Daily Global Maps. This may be based on different criteria, such as dust clouds, dust storm texture/convective structures, and atmospheric fronts. Manual identification will be backed up by comparisons against the performance of automatic dust storm detection and/or machine learning methods.<EOS>
<BOS>Once EMM begins its science phase, the researcher will focus on EMM observations (and/or EMM data synthesized with models using data assimilation methods, on a make-available basis) as the main source of information about Martian dust storms. This will include quantitative constraints on key parameters related to the formation of dust storms, such as dust optical depth, atmospheric and surface temperatures, surface winds, etc. The objective of this part of the work is to generate a comprehensive database of Mars dust storms.<EOS>
<BOS>During both phases of the project, the postdoctoral fellow is also expected to pursue independent research in the field of Mars dust storm physics/dynamics/meteorology. Should the successful candidate have the required expertise and aptitude, this may include the use of Mars Global Climate Models (MGCMs) on the UAEU's supercomputing cluster.<EOS>

<BOS>Postdoctoral Researcher position (f/m/d)<EOS>
<BOS>“ StressRegNet: Exploring stressor-regulator pairs in bacterial stress response, virulence, and antibiotic sensitivity using high-throughput approaches and machine learning ”<EOS>
<BOS>Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher position at the chair of “Molecular Infection Biology II” (Cynthia Sharma) in Würzburg. Successful candidates will work in an interdisciplinary team in the framework of our collaborative “StressRegNet” consortium together with the groups of Ana Rita Brochado (Biocenter, Würzburg) and Christian Müller (Dept. of Statistics, LMU Munich). In our project, we aim to explore signals (stressors) and regulatory pathways controlling adaptation to the host and to antibiotics in the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni . We will employ a chemical-genomics approach to profile growth and transcriptional phenotypes of a reporter-strain library of selected regulators in response to >3,000 host-related chemical stimuli (small molecules). Machine learning approaches will be employed for data and network analysis, followed by functional characterization of selected stressor-regulator pairs using genomics, molecular biology, and bacterial genetics methods. In particular, we aim to identify signals from the host or environment that control expression of small, regulatory RNAs that control virulence or antibiotics sensitivity pathways. Our three groups join expertise in RNA biology, bacterial pathogens, high-throughput screening approaches, antibiotics resistance, and statistics as well as machine learning approaches.<EOS>
<BOS>Further information: The Sharma lab studies mechanisms of gene regulation in stress response and virulence control of the human pathogens Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni . We employ diverse deep-sequencing based approaches (RNA-seq, RIP-seq, Ribo-seq, Tn-seq) for transcriptome and translatome analyses and to identify novel virulence factors and regulators. We are especially interested in mechanisms of RNA-based regulation via small regulatory RNAs, RNA binding proteins and/or bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems. Furthermore, we also develop and apply 3D infection models based on tissue engineering to study host-pathogen interactions. For further information, please see for example also our following publications: Alzheimer et al, 2020, PLoS Pathogens, PMID: 32069333; Dugar et al, 2018, Molecular Cell, PMID: 29499139; Dugar et al, 2016, Nature Communications, PMID: 27229370; Pernitzsch et al, 2014, PNAS, PMID: 24474799 or our website:<EOS>

<BOS>The National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) at UAE University (UAEU) in Al Ain, UAE seeks a candidate to join its Planetary Science Group (and the wider Earth and Planetary Science Unit) as a postdoctoral fellow. His/her focus will be on Mars dust storm research in preparation for and in support of the exploitation of scientific data from the upcoming Emirates Mars Mission (EMM, https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/), under the supervision of Dr Claus Gebhardt. The anticipated start date is as soon as possible but is likely to be sometime during late Fall 2020, for an initial 2-year period. Review of applications will begin on 6 September 2020, and the position will remain open until filled. Enquiries about the position should be made to Dr Claus Gebhardt at claus.gebhardt@uaeu.ac.ae.<EOS>
<BOS>The EMM science phase is scheduled to start in early-to-mid 2021. EMM is expected to provide an unprecedented dataset of satellite images covering the Martian surface and atmosphere.<EOS>
<BOS>The planned work will start with imagery and dust-climatological-data from past and existing Mars satellite missions. The initial goal is a study to gauge the feasibility of extracting information about Mars dust storms from such observations. It is common practice to identify dust storms manually by the visual inspection of Mars Daily Global Maps. This may be based on different criteria, such as dust clouds, dust storm texture/convective structures, and atmospheric fronts. Manual identification will be backed up by comparisons against the performance of automatic dust storm detection and/or machine learning methods.<EOS>
<BOS>Once EMM begins its science phase, the researcher will focus on EMM observations (and/or EMM data synthesized with models using data assimilation methods, on a make-available basis) as the main source of information about Martian dust storms. This will include quantitative constraints on key parameters related to the formation of dust storms, such as dust optical depth, atmospheric and surface temperatures, surface winds, etc. The objective of this part of the work is to generate a comprehensive database of Mars dust storms.<EOS>
<BOS>During both phases of the project, the postdoctoral fellow is also expected to pursue independent research in the field of Mars dust storm physics/dynamics/meteorology. Should the successful candidate have the required expertise and aptitude, this may include the use of Mars Global Climate Models (MGCMs) on the UAEU’s supercomputing cluster.<EOS>

It is part of a network of testbed facilities sponsored by the NOAA. These organizations facilitate the orderly transition of applied research capabilities to operational implementation. This transition is accomplished through rigorous developmental testing and pre-deployment evaluation for operational readiness and sustainability. The unique niche filled by the OPG is to represent NWS field offices in the research-to-operations (R2O) process. The OPG facility has developed the capability to configure itself as any NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO), or to emulate operational practices for up to five different WFOs simultaneously. Through the OPG, a new tool, data set, forecast technique, or decision aid can be integrated into a WFO production environment to evaluate whether it adds value to the forecast process with no appreciable negative impact on existing systems and practices. Many of the experiments and evaluations executed by the OPG have focused on application of satellite imagery, data, and products to improve operational analysis and forecasting. The advent of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES)-R era has resulted in forecasters having near real-time access to satellite data at higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions than ever before. Thus, the opportunity to capitalize on this rich resource, and find ways to fuse these data with other tools to enhance insight and improve decision-making, are manifold.The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University (CSU) is a collaborating partner with the OPG as part of the Satellite Proving Ground, where both operational and experimental satellite products are tested and evaluated for their capacity to improve NWS operations.<EOS>
<BOS>CIRA proposes to support the expanding use of satellite-based weather products by placing a CIRA satellite researcher at the NWS OPG in Kansas City, MO.Position SummaryThe individual in this position will report to the AWT Meteorologist/Developer Team Lead and work closely with CIRA researchers, scientists at the NOAA/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)/The Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR), the GOES-R Program Office, and the staff at the OPG and provide leadership, satellite expertise, and meteorological support for the Satellite Proving Ground efforts based at the OPG. Specifically the individual in this position will actively pursue the testing of new satellite products and decision aids. This endeavor will entail activities focused on maximizing the forecast value of satellite data and products, particularly activities centered on NWS WFO operations to improve forecast and warning services to the nation. The individual in this position will interact with NWS operational forecasters, NESDIS satellite analysts, academia, and the meteorological research community to prepare and evaluate operational and experimental products for potential integration into NWS WFO operations. The Director of OPG will serve as the Federal Advisor for the individual in this position.<EOS>

The AWC is located in Kansas City, MO and has a long history of providing operational global aviation weather forecasts and warnings for the NWS, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), industry, and aviators around the globe. The Aviation Weather Testbed (AWT) is co-located with the AWC and supports the transition of aviation research into operations for the NWS, the FAA, and their partners. The AWC and AWT collaborate with universities, governmental forecast centers and research laboratories, FAA organizations, International Meteorological Watch Offices, and other NOAA and NWS organizations. The AWC maintains 24Ã—7 global forecasting and warning operations, and the AWT supports aviation meteorology hazards training, applied research, and transitioning research-to-operations. The AWC and AWT are also actively engaged in supporting the FAA's NextGen weather initiative in building a 4-Dimensional Weather Data Cube (4-D Cube) that will improve access and accuracy of weather information to support improvements to aviation services in the NextGen era. Activities within the AWT and AWC will play a significant role in the development, testing, and evaluation of NextGen development. The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University (CSU) is a collaborating partner with the AWC on a number of research projects and activities. CIRA professionals assist the AWC/AWT in supporting, developing, testing, and transitioning aviation weather research into NWS operations.The NWS Operations Proving Ground (OPG) is part of a network of testbed facilities sponsored by the NOAA. These organizations facilitate the orderly transition of applied research capabilities to operational implementation. This transition is accomplished through rigorous developmental testing and pre-deployment evaluation for operational readiness and sustainability. The unique niche filled by the OPG is to represent NWS field offices in the research-to-operations (R2O) process. The OPG facility has developed the capability to configure itself as any NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO), or to emulate operational practices for up to five different WFOs simultaneously. Through the OPG, a new tool, data set, forecast technique, or decision aid can be integrated into a WFO production environment to evaluate whether it adds value to the forecast process with no appreciable negative impact on existing systems and practices. Many of the experiments and evaluations executed by the OPG have focused on application of satellite imagery, data, and products to improve operational analysis and forecasting. The advent of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES)-R era has resulted in forecasters having near real-time access to satellite data at higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions than ever before. Thus, the opportunity to capitalize on this rich resource, and find ways to fuse these data with other tools to enhance insight and improve decision-making, are manifold.CIRA proposes to support the expanding use of satellite-based weather products by placing a CIRA satellite researcher at the NWS OPG in Kansas City, MO.Position SummaryThe individual in this position will report to the AWT Meteorologist/Developer Team Lead and work closely with CIRA researchers, scientists at the NOAA/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)/The Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR), the GOES-R Program Office, and the staff at the OPG and provide leadership, satellite expertise, and meteorological support for the Satellite Proving Ground efforts based at the OPG. Specifically the individual in this position will actively pursue the testing of new satellite products and decision aids. This endeavor will entail activities focused on maximizing the forecast value of satellite data and products, particularly activities centered on NWS WFO operations to improve forecast and warning services to the nation. The individual in this position will interact with NWS operational forecasters, NESDIS satellite analysts, academia, and the meteorological research community to prepare and evaluate operational and experimental products for potential integration into NWS WFO operations. The Director of OPG will serve as the Federal Advisor for the individual in this position.<EOS>
