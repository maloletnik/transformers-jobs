<BOS>Structure Description<EOS>
<BOS>The recruited person will be hosted by the Mathematical and Computational Biology team of the TIMC laboratory, with mobility to the Alpine Ecology Laboratory (University of Grenoble-Alpes LECA UMR 5553).<EOS>
<BOS>The theme of the MCB (BCM) team is data science and modeling for living and health sciences. The team is developing fundamental approaches and mathematical models for the analysis and interpretation of biological data, particularly from high-throughput technologies, essential for understanding the mechanisms of living organisms. The research carried out at LECA aims to respond to the crucial challenges linked to global change, loss of biodiversity and pollution. The LECA's scientific themes are centered on ecology, environment and evolution. In accordance with the very definition of biodiversity, the scales of study range from genes to ecosystems and landscapes, including the processes acting on each scale.<EOS>
<BOS>The recruited person will interact with Wilfried Thuiller (LECA) and Olivier François (TIMC), and integrate an inter-laboratory and interdisciplinary group made up of a dozen people.<EOS>
<BOS>Develop and apply new statistical methods for predictive ecological genomics based on environmental DNA. The statistical methods will use machine learning approaches and latent variable models. In collaboration with ecologists, the developed algorithms will be applied to the study of Alpine biotopes.<EOS>
<BOS>The recruited candidate will develop data-based approaches to simulate artificial eDNA samples in a more realistic way than methods based on existing models. The simulators will exploit deep learning to implement optimization algorithms for Bayesian auto-encoders. In a first step, the role of the researcher will be to use environmental DNA and machine learning methods to predict joint distributions of species, where hundreds of thousands of species are screened through high-throughput DNA sequencing. This step will involve developing deep variational auto-encoder models. The models will be used to make inferences on the structure of the communities and to simulate meta-genomes under various scenarios of environmental change. To this aim, deep neural networks will be developed to simulate replicas of meta-genomes from current samples. In a second step, the role of the post-doc will consist in defining concepts of ecological contexts in order to reduce the dimension of the occurrence data by using embeddings techniques. More traditional methods, such as Bayesian networks and graphical models, will then be chained to reduced representations of species occurrence data and used to infer interactions between species. The researcher will be in charge of organizing work meetings and interacting with the other members of the group. The candidate will contribute to the method design, develop algorithms and computer programs, perform analyzes and write research and review articles.<EOS>

Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, HII employs more than 42,000 people operating both domestically and internationally.<EOS>
<BOS>The Director of Technology is the primary staff member responsible for ensuring the development of proposal winning technical solutions, advancing the delivery of technology on existing programs, directing internal research and development, advising on technology trends in support of business strategy, and assessing the technical utility of M&A targets.<EOS>
<BOS>The successful candidate will be an acknowledged expert in “systems thinking” and have demonstrated experience solving systems level problems across a broad range of markets such as ISR, intelligence, cyber, IT, maintenance and sustainment, and product lifecycle support.
