While there has been a lot of progress on both machine learning and machine reasoning, their integration remains a key open challenge in artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. The distinction between learning and reasoning is related to the differences between fast and slow thinking, between data-driven and knowledge-based approaches, and between symbolic versus subsymbolic representations. The project will build upon probabilistic (logic) programming and neuro-symbolic computation, which are different paradigms for integrating learning and reasoning. The former integrates logical and probabilistic graphical models, the later logical and neural approaches. The goal of the project is to develop probabilistic programming and neuro-symbolic approaches and systems, and apply them to autonomous sensor systems.

The researcher will be part of a joint collaboration between the 5G and AI groups at i2CAT. This work will be part of the OpenVerso project where i2CAT is developing new algorithms and architectures for beyond 5G networks.\n\nAs Part Of Its Thesis The Researcher Will Investigate\n\nI2CAT has a wide experience in the management and control of 5G networks based on SDN/NFV architectures. Hence, the researcher will have access to integrated 5G network testbeds and prototypes comprising radio, transport and compute domains.\nArchitectural extensions to the current 5G networks to support AI/ML management functions, including identifying what data needs to be collected from the various network domains, and what actions need to be enabled by the underlying 5G SDN/NFV architecture. As part of the architectural work the researcher will also investigate what ML frameworks are available to manage the lifecycle of machine learning models, which could be containerized and executed within the 5G network.\nIn addition to the architectural aspects, the researcher will spend most of its effort researching on algorithm design. A promising avenue being investigated at the moment is the application of Reinforcement Learning algorithms to network control and management use cases. However, the researcher will also consider supervised and unsupervised learning if needed. The following work-plan will be considered. First, a use case for the radio domain and a use case for the compute or transport domain will be defined. Second, the researcher will investigate how to set up an appropriate environment to test the developed algorithms, e.g. a network simulator. Third, the researcher will develop AI/ML algorithms for the two use cases. Finally, the researcher will validate the developed algorithms in the 5G testbed infrastructures available at i2CAT.\nThe researcher is expected to generate publications throughout this work, and actively contribute to the OpenVerso project.\n\nWho We Are\n\ni2CAT Foundation is a non-profit research and innovation center that promotes mission-oriented R&D activities on advanced Internet architectures, applications and services.

His/her focus will be on Mars dust storm research in preparation for and in support of the exploitation of scientific data from the upcoming Emirates Mars Mission, under the supervision of Dr Claus Gebhardt.\n\nThe anticipated start date is as soon as possible but is likely to be sometime during late Fall 2020, for an initial 2-year period. Review of applications will begin on 6 September 2020, and the position will remain open until filled.\n\nThe EMM science phase is scheduled to start in early-to-mid 2021. EMM is expected to provide an unprecedented dataset of satellite images covering the Martian surface and atmosphere. The planned work will start with imagery and dust-climatological-data from past and existing Mars satellite missions. The initial goal is a study to gauge the feasibility of extracting information about Mars dust storms from such observations. It is common practice to identify dust storms manually by the visual inspection of Mars Daily Global Maps. This may be based on different criteria, such as dust clouds, dust storm texture/convective structures, and atmospheric fronts. Manual identification will be backed up by comparisons against the performance of automatic dust storm detection and/or machine learning methods.\n\nOnce EMM begins its science phase, the researcher will focus on EMM observations (and/or EMM data synthesized with models using data assimilation methods, on a make-available basis) as the main source of information about Martian dust storms. This will include quantitative constraints on key parameters related to the formation of dust storms, such as dust optical depth, atmospheric and surface temperatures, surface winds, etc. The objective of this part of the work is to generate a comprehensive database of Mars dust storms.\n\nDuring both phases of the project, the postdoctoral fellow is also expected to pursue independent research in the field of Mars dust storm physics/dynamics/meteorology.

In our project, we aim to explore signals (stressors) and regulatory pathways controlling adaptation to the host and to antibiotics in the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni . We will employ a chemical-genomics approach to profile growth and transcriptional phenotypes of a reporter-strain library of selected regulators in response to >3,000 host-related chemical stimuli (small molecules). Machine learning approaches will be employed for data and network analysis, followed by functional characterization of selected stressor-regulator pairs using genomics, molecular biology, and bacterial genetics methods. In particular, we aim to identify signals from the host or environment that control expression of small, regulatory RNAs that control virulence or antibiotics sensitivity pathways. Our three groups join expertise in RNA biology, bacterial pathogens, high-throughput screening approaches, antibiotics resistance, and statistics as well as machine learning approaches.\nFurther information: The Sharma lab studies mechanisms of gene regulation in stress response and virulence control of the human pathogens Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni . We employ diverse deep-sequencing based approaches (RNA-seq, RIP-seq, Ribo-seq, Tn-seq) for transcriptome and translatome analyses and to identify novel virulence factors and regulators. We are especially interested in mechanisms of RNA-based regulation via small regulatory RNAs, RNA binding proteins and/or bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems. Furthermore, we also develop and apply 3D infection models based on tissue engineering to study host-pathogen interactions.

His/her focus will be on Mars dust storm research in preparation for and in support of the exploitation of scientific data from the upcoming Emirates Mars Mission (EMM, https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/), under the supervision of Dr Claus Gebhardt. The anticipated start date is as soon as possible but is likely to be sometime during late Fall 2020, for an initial 2-year period. Review of applications will begin on 6 September 2020, and the position will remain open until filled. Enquiries about the position should be made to Dr Claus Gebhardt at claus.gebhardt@uaeu.ac.ae.\nThe EMM science phase is scheduled to start in early-to-mid 2021. EMM is expected to provide an unprecedented dataset of satellite images covering the Martian surface and atmosphere.\nThe planned work will start with imagery and dust-climatological-data from past and existing Mars satellite missions. The initial goal is a study to gauge the feasibility of extracting information about Mars dust storms from such observations. It is common practice to identify dust storms manually by the visual inspection of Mars Daily Global Maps. This may be based on different criteria, such as dust clouds, dust storm texture/convective structures, and atmospheric fronts. Manual identification will be backed up by comparisons against the performance of automatic dust storm detection and/or machine learning methods.\nOnce EMM begins its science phase, the researcher will focus on EMM observations (and/or EMM data synthesized with models using data assimilation methods, on a make-available basis) as the main source of information about Martian dust storms. This will include quantitative constraints on key parameters related to the formation of dust storms, such as dust optical depth, atmospheric and surface temperatures, surface winds, etc. The objective of this part of the work is to generate a comprehensive database of Mars dust storms.\nDuring both phases of the project, the postdoctoral fellow is also expected to pursue independent research in the field of Mars dust storm physics/dynamics/meteorology.

It is part of a network of testbed facilities sponsored by the NOAA. These organizations facilitate the orderly transition of applied research capabilities to operational implementation. This transition is accomplished through rigorous developmental testing and pre-deployment evaluation for operational readiness and sustainability. The unique niche filled by the OPG is to represent NWS field offices in the research-to-operations (R2O) process. The OPG facility has developed the capability to configure itself as any NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO), or to emulate operational practices for up to five different WFOs simultaneously. Through the OPG, a new tool, data set, forecast technique, or decision aid can be integrated into a WFO production environment to evaluate whether it adds value to the forecast process with no appreciable negative impact on existing systems and practices. Many of the experiments and evaluations executed by the OPG have focused on application of satellite imagery, data, and products to improve operational analysis and forecasting. The advent of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES)-R era has resulted in forecasters having near real-time access to satellite data at higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions than ever before. Thus, the opportunity to capitalize on this rich resource, and find ways to fuse these data with other tools to enhance insight and improve decision-making, are manifold.The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University (CSU) is a collaborating partner with the OPG as part of the Satellite Proving Ground, where both operational and experimental satellite products are tested and evaluated for their capacity to improve NWS operations.\n\nCIRA proposes to support the expanding use of satellite-based weather products by placing a CIRA satellite researcher at the NWS OPG in Kansas City, MO.Position SummaryThe individual in this position will report to the AWT Meteorologist/Developer Team Lead and work closely with CIRA researchers, scientists at the NOAA/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)/The Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR), the GOES-R Program Office, and the staff at the OPG and provide leadership, satellite expertise, and meteorological support for the Satellite Proving Ground efforts based at the OPG. Specifically the individual in this position will actively pursue the testing of new satellite products and decision aids. This endeavor will entail activities focused on maximizing the forecast value of satellite data and products, particularly activities centered on NWS WFO operations to improve forecast and warning services to the nation. The individual in this position will interact with NWS operational forecasters, NESDIS satellite analysts, academia, and the meteorological research community to prepare and evaluate operational and experimental products for potential integration into NWS WFO operations.

The AWC is located in Kansas City, MO and has a long history of providing operational global aviation weather forecasts and warnings for the NWS, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), industry, and aviators around the globe. The Aviation Weather Testbed (AWT) is co-located with the AWC and supports the transition of aviation research into operations for the NWS, the FAA, and their partners. The AWC and AWT collaborate with universities, governmental forecast centers and research laboratories, FAA organizations, International Meteorological Watch Offices, and other NOAA and NWS organizations. The AWC maintains 24\u00c3\u20147 global forecasting and warning operations, and the AWT supports aviation meteorology hazards training, applied research, and transitioning research-to-operations. The AWC and AWT are also actively engaged in supporting the FAA's NextGen weather initiative in building a 4-Dimensional Weather Data Cube (4-D Cube) that will improve access and accuracy of weather information to support improvements to aviation services in the NextGen era. Activities within the AWT and AWC will play a significant role in the development, testing, and evaluation of NextGen development. The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University (CSU) is a collaborating partner with the AWC on a number of research projects and activities. CIRA professionals assist the AWC/AWT in supporting, developing, testing, and transitioning aviation weather research into NWS operations.The NWS Operations Proving Ground (OPG) is part of a network of testbed facilities sponsored by the NOAA. These organizations facilitate the orderly transition of applied research capabilities to operational implementation. This transition is accomplished through rigorous developmental testing and pre-deployment evaluation for operational readiness and sustainability. The unique niche filled by the OPG is to represent NWS field offices in the research-to-operations (R2O) process. The OPG facility has developed the capability to configure itself as any NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO), or to emulate operational practices for up to five different WFOs simultaneously. Through the OPG, a new tool, data set, forecast technique, or decision aid can be integrated into a WFO production environment to evaluate whether it adds value to the forecast process with no appreciable negative impact on existing systems and practices. Many of the experiments and evaluations executed by the OPG have focused on application of satellite imagery, data, and products to improve operational analysis and forecasting. The advent of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES)-R era has resulted in forecasters having near real-time access to satellite data at higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions than ever before. Thus, the opportunity to capitalize on this rich resource, and find ways to fuse these data with other tools to enhance insight and improve decision-making, are manifold.CIRA proposes to support the expanding use of satellite-based weather products by placing a CIRA satellite researcher at the NWS OPG in Kansas City, MO.Position SummaryThe individual in this position will report to the AWT Meteorologist/Developer Team Lead and work closely with CIRA researchers, scientists at the NOAA/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)/The Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR), the GOES-R Program Office, and the staff at the OPG and provide leadership, satellite expertise, and meteorological support for the Satellite Proving Ground efforts based at the OPG. Specifically the individual in this position will actively pursue the testing of new satellite products and decision aids.

The team is developing fundamental approaches and mathematical models for the analysis and interpretation of biological data, particularly from high-throughput technologies, essential for understanding the mechanisms of living organisms. The research carried out at LECA aims to respond to the crucial challenges linked to global change, loss of biodiversity and pollution. The LECA's scientific themes are centered on ecology, environment and evolution. In accordance with the very definition of biodiversity, the scales of study range from genes to ecosystems and landscapes, including the processes acting on each scale.\n\nTeam description\n\nThe recruited person will interact with Wilfried Thuiller (LECA) and Olivier Fran\u00e7ois (TIMC), and integrate an inter-laboratory and interdisciplinary group made up of a dozen people.\n\nOffer Description\n\nMission\n\nDevelop and apply new statistical methods for predictive ecological genomics based on environmental DNA. The statistical methods will use machine learning approaches and latent variable models. In collaboration with ecologists, the developed algorithms will be applied to the study of Alpine biotopes.\n\nMain Activities\n\nThe recruited candidate will develop data-based approaches to simulate artificial eDNA samples in a more realistic way than methods based on existing models. The simulators will exploit deep learning to implement optimization algorithms for Bayesian auto-encoders. In a first step, the role of the researcher will be to use environmental DNA and machine learning methods to predict joint distributions of species, where hundreds of thousands of species are screened through high-throughput DNA sequencing. This step will involve developing deep variational auto-encoder models. The models will be used to make inferences on the structure of the communities and to simulate meta-genomes under various scenarios of environmental change. To this aim, deep neural networks will be developed to simulate replicas of meta-genomes from current samples. In a second step, the role of the post-doc will consist in defining concepts of ecological contexts in order to reduce the dimension of the occurrence data by using embeddings techniques. More traditional methods, such as Bayesian networks and graphical models, will then be chained to reduced representations of species occurrence data and used to infer interactions between species. The researcher will be in charge of organizing work meetings and interacting with the other members of the group. The candidate will contribute to the method design, develop algorithms and computer programs, perform analyzes and write research and review articles.", "Huntington Ingalls Industries is America\u2019s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry.
